# M2_LED_BLINKING

## Introduction
* It is simple led Blinking project, Now a days leds used every where with that we can do anything like designs, lighingpatterns, holograms, Automobiles, etc with that
  ATmega328 is an eight bit AVR (Advanced Virtual RISC) based microcontroller. It is a powerful microcontroller with a built-in  internal memory of around 32Kb. Most     Arduino boards consist of an Atmel 8-bit AVR microcontroller with varying amounts of flash memory, pins, and features.
  AVR microcontrollers are very easy to use. All AVR microcontrollers require Integrated Development Environment(IDE) such as Simuide. Using this IDE, we can create, compile and debug program on all AVR microcontrollers.

## Used components

* ATMEGA328
* leds
* push Switch
* resister

# Analysis- Strengths, and Weakness

## Strengths

* looks attractive.
* longLIfe span
* More Environmentally Friendly
* Easy to modify the light colours,designs,etc...
* Energy Saving and Low cost.

### Weakness
* Bad Color Revivification
* Heat Dissipation


# 4W's and 1'H
